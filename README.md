# wudi-database
## Overview
This repository is dedicated to project 2 (`p2`). It contains CSV files as required by the project. Additionally, a database named `p2.db` has been set up for convenience and has undergone verification. 

## Contents

- `g8.txt`: This file lists the group names and associated email addresses.

## Instructions
1. Clone the repository to your local machine.
2. Navigate to the directory containing the `p2.db` database file.
3. Start SQLite with the `p2.db` file.
4. To run any SQL query, like those in `q1.sql`, use the `.read` command inside the SQLite prompt.
